# Simple CRUD with Property Container Pattern


**Property Container Pattern** - provided for dynamically acquiring objects with available attributes at run time. In addition, a few more modules may be suggested at the time of placement that explicitly use the new properties, if one has been added.

```sh
get(); set(); Realisation
```
